## Usage Guide

### Client Onboarding
1. **Basic Information**: Enter client name, industry, contact details, and company size
2. **Documents**: Upload NDAs, contracts, or policies (optional, max 3 files, 10MB each)
3. **Notes**: Add initial observations or special requirements (optional, max 500 chars)
4. **Review & Submit**: Review all information and submit to add client

### Assessment Process
1. **Select Client**: Choose from the sidebar dropdown
2. **Navigate Functions**: Use expandable sections for each NIST CSF function
3. **Assess Subcategories**: Set status, score (1-10), add notes, and upload evidence
4. **Review Progress**: Monitor completion percentage and identify gaps
5. **Export Results**: Download assessments as JSON for reporting

### Gap Analysis
- Automatically identifies subcategories with scores < 5
- Provides remediation recommendations
- Exportable as CSV for further analysis

### Evidence Management
- Upload supporting documents (PDF, DOCX, PNG, JPG)
- Search and filter evidence by file name or subcategory
- Track upload dates and organize by assessment area

## Technical Features

### Accessibility
- **ARIA labels** for screen readers
- **Keyboard navigation** support
- **High contrast** mode compatibility
- **Responsive design** for mobile devices

### Security
- **File validation** with size and type restrictions
- **Session state** for data persistence (no sensitive data in frontend)
- **Mock API** structure ready for secure backend integration

### Performance
- **Lazy loading** of assessment data
- **Efficient file handling** with size validation
- **Optimized rendering** with Streamlit best practices

## Customization

### Styling
The application uses a professional CSS theme defined in `assets/style.css`:
- **Color scheme**: Blue primary with high contrast
- **Typography**: Sans-serif fonts for readability
- **Responsive design**: Mobile-friendly layout
- **Dark mode**: Automatic theme detection

### Data Structure
- **Clients**: Stored in `st.session_state.clients` as list of dictionaries
- **Assessments**: Stored in `st.session_state.assessments` as nested dictionaries
- **Evidence**: File names stored in `st.session_state.evidence_files`

### Adding New Standards
To add support for additional cybersecurity frameworks:
1. Create JSON file in `data/` directory
2. Update `src/utils.py` to load new framework
3. Modify assessment interface to handle new structure

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- **PDF report generation** using FPDF2
- **Real-time collaboration** for team assessments
- **Advanced analytics** with trend analysis
- **Integration APIs** for external tools
- **Automated scoring** based on evidence analysis

### Backend Integration
The application is designed for easy backend integration:
- **REST API endpoints** for data persistence
- **File storage** for evidence management
- **User authentication** and authorization
- **Audit logging** for compliance tracking

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Import errors**: Ensure all dependencies are installed
2. **File upload issues**: Check file size and format restrictions
3. **Session state**: Refresh page if data appears inconsistent
4. **Port conflicts**: Use different port if 8503 is occupied
